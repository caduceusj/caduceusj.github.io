              I'm a passionate game programmer fueled by challenges (and coffee), always aiming to create experiences that make players say, 'Just one more round!' Video games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, and my love for them has only grown over time. I'm constantly on the lookout for new learning opportunities and ways to push my limits, because the game never ends when it comes to expanding my knowledge.

      <h2 class="mb-4">Malleus Maleficarum</h2>
      <p>Winner of HallowJam 2023 in Natal, RN, this Metroidvania, inspired by classic titles and developed in Godot 4.2, tells the gripping story of Mirabel. She hails from a small village plagued for generations by witch attacks, led by the malevolent Ursula and her faction, the 'Dames of the Night.' These witches, humanoid creatures from lower dimensions, kidnap young girls to mark them with a seal of hatred, granting them dark powers.

        Mirabel herself was captured during a witch attack that claimed her family. She was marked with the seal but later rescued by the 'Order of the Fire Cross,' a group of hunters formed by the local church to combat the witches. Now, driven by revenge, Mirabel fights to destroy the witches that ruined her life.
        
        I programmed all the core mechanics for this game and had my first experience working with State Machines. Development flowed smoothly, and my friends and I are excited to create an expanded version of the game. Although this version is only available in Portuguese, our next official release—a larger Metroidvania featuring Mirabel's quest for vengeance—will be in English!</p>

      <p>Fofoca was developed during the GMTK Game Jam using Godot 4.3, marking my first project in Godot with 3D elements. It was a fantastic learning experience, especially with pathfinding, state machines, and creating interactions where NPCs gossip with each other. The goal of the game is simple: spread a rumor around town while making sure not to gossip to the person the rumor is about! The game also features a built-in tutorial to guide players.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">Baroneza</h2>
      <p>My first full project as a programmer was built using Godot 3.5. In this game, I was responsible for implementing enemies, designing stages, integrating assets, and creating a unique Enter The Gungeon-inspired shooting mechanic—except with a bow and arrow! This project taught me a great deal about working within a team and developing a cohesive, enjoyable game experience, even though it wasn't very long. I'm proud to say that this game was one of the finalists in the Game Jam Plus 2022</p>

      <p>Developed in Godot 4.3 during a 3-week game jam at our college's Game Laboratory, this arcade game challenges you to reach the highest floor in an endless building within just 24.1 seconds. You’ll always have 3 elevator options, each with its own unique gimmick, and mastering these mechanics is key to climbing as high as possible. This is one of those projects I always look back on with pride—it’s the one where everything came together in a really well-rounded way</p>

      <p>
        "This was my first project using Unity, where I took on the role of Game Designer for a Game Jam. I also developed one of the minigames featured in the game. In this game, you play as a game tester hired by a company to ensure that the games sent to you don't infringe on intellectual property rights. Your task is to compare the assets in the games with a folder of copyrighted materials from the company and identify any stolen sprites. But there's a catch—your time is limited, so you'll need to act fast!
        
        Players must test several games, performing well enough to unlock all the available content. The challenge lies in spotting stolen assets and accurately reporting how many have been used to protect the company's intellectual property. Points are awarded based on performance, and players only have one minute to identify the stolen assets before answering questions about their findings.
        
        It was a fun and challenging experience, combining quick reflexes with a detective-like attention to detail, and it helped sharpen my Unity development skills while exploring creative game design!"
