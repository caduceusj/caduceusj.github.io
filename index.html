<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome to my Webpage Stranger :D.</h1>
<p> My name is João Anisio and I like to develop games, i was born in Brazil and always had a passion about it, at the moment I'm focusing on Baroneza developed during the Game Jam Plus period,
in which we were champions among the people of our region. <br> <br>  in the game i'm being responsible for developing the game mechanics and programming it, I admit that as it is the first time that I perform this function I am in a constant and emerging learning process, the engine I am using for the development of the game is Godot Version 3.5 
     <br> <br> The version developed during Game Jam Plus is already published on itch.io, with the download link below!, if you can leave a constructive comment about the game our team would be very grateful! <br> <br> <br> <br></p>
